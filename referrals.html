		<p>These are some products and services that I recommend. If you sign up for a subscription or buy something using the links on this page, you'll save money and I may get a small cut. Win-win.</p>

		<h2>NextDNS</h2>
		<p>NextDNS is a cloud-based content filter that can block tracking scripts and other unwanted content across your entire network. I use it to <a href="https://twitter.com/corbindavenport/status/1290156591434485761" target="_blank">block apps communicating with Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/corbindavenport/status/1295152142764867584" target="_blank">remove ads in apps preinstalled on Samsung phones</a>, and much more. My favorite feature is that it can be used as the system DNS provider on Android 9.0+ without installing any apps.</p>
		<p><a href="https://nextdns.io/?from=h8esucxz" target="_blank" class="button-link">Sign up for NextDNS</a></p>
		<p><i>Disclosure: If you decide to sign up for a paid plan, I get 30% of the revenue from the first 12 months.</i></p>

		<h2>Dropbox</h2>
		<p>Dropbox is a cloud storage service that I've used for around two years. It's more expensive than competitiors like Google Drive and OneDrive, but the mobile and desktop applications work well. I use Dropbox mainly beacuse it's the only major cloud service that supports Linux, and I like that you can edit Microsoft Office documents from the Dropbox website using Office Online. If you create an account with the link below, even a free one, you get 500MB of extra storage.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/AAAH9xLAkC1-Qq7ucoUKlFCJ9VbMQyAxTqE?src=global9" target="_blank" class="button-link">Sign up for Dropbox</a></p>
		<p><i>Disclosure: I receive 1GB of extra storage when you create an account.</i></p>

		<h2>Samsung</h2>
		<p>The Samsung Galaxy S20 is currently my favorite phone, and I also purchased a Galaxy Tab S6 that I frequently use for work and streaming media. If you use the below link to purchase something from Samsung's website, you can get 5% off. Entering code <b>ref-4ckb48</b> at checkout also works.</p>
		<p><a href="https://shopsamsung.page.link/1RWnP9Sb9wBZ3bcN9" target="_blank" class="button-link">Shop at Samsung</a></p>
		<p><i>Disclosure: If you purchase something, I get 5% of the product's value in points, which I can then use to buy more Samsung stuff.</i></p>

		<h2>Cricket Wireless</h2>
		<p>Cricket is a cell carrier that uses AT&T's nation-wide network and generally has good prices. I've had my main phone number on Cricket for over a year, and I haven't had to ever contact customer support, which is about the best praise you can probably give for a carrier. If you use the below link, you get may $25 of service credit after 60 days (Cricket only allows 10 referrals per year).</p>

		<p><i>Disclosure: I also get $25 in service credit if you sign up.</i></p>
